What is DSA:

DSA is Data Structure and Algorithm. The way to manage our application performace. DS and A are both seperate things which are as follow:


Data Structure:
DS is Data structure it means than the way how 
the data is stored  in our RAM - The efficient way to store data in our RAM / Efficient usage of RAM. 

Algorithms:
It is a sequence of step to solve a given problem. How to execute any problem or solve any problem in an efficient way. There should be millions of method to solve
one specific problem but we have to choose the best and efficient one in which DSA helps.


Some terms to know about: 

Databse: Database is a simple HDD or SSD present in any system or server. It store a data to perform CRUD operation. It is used for Faster Reterival.

Dataware House: It is also known as Management of Huge Legacy Data. Which means the old data which is not wanted or the data which is not required to be kept 
inside the system. It is a special type of system which is sperated from main system.

Big Data: The data which is soo big which can not be handeled by normal system or normal DSA. It requires a special Alogs and Data Structure.

Memory Architecture:

It consist of following in order of bottom to top:

Heap : The dynamic memory which should be provided on demand and cleared once the work is done.
Stack : The LIFO technique in which
